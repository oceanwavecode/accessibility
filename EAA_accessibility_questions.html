  <p>The European Accessibility Act (EAA) will be implemented June 28, 2025. Will your organisation's digital products and services meet the requirements in time?</p>

  <h4>You may find the following user interface and functionality design questions useful (questions refer to Section I of Annex I):</h4>

  <ul>
   <li>Do your products' user interfaces support multiple sensory channels? Vision, Auditory, Speech, Touch.</li>

   <li>Do the user interfaces of your products provide an alternative to speech output/vocal input for communication, operation control, and orientation?</li>

   <li>Do visual elements of your products support flexible magnification, brightness, and contrast?</li>

   <li>Can assistive devices be used to navigate the visual elements of your products?</li>

   <li>Do your products provide an alternative to colour/audio when colour/audio is used to indicate an action, require a response, or identify elements?</li>

   <li>Do your products provide volume, speed, and audio clarity options (e.g. reduce audio of other applications)?</li>

   <li>Do your products ensure there are no features that require simultaneous controls?</li>

   <li>Does your product include content that could trigger photosensitive seizures?</li>

   <li>Does the use of accessibility features ensure the user's privacy?</li>

   <li>Does your product solely rely on biometric identification? If so, you will need to provide an alternative.</li>

   <li>Are there features within your products that move too fast for some users to interact with?</li>

   <li>Do your products provide software and hardware for interfacing with assistive technologies?</li>

   <li>Is your support team able to provide information about the accessible capability of your products and compatibility with assistive technologies?</li>

   <li>Do you engage with users who rely on accessible product features to analyse quantitative and qualitative data to improve product accessibility?</li>
  </ul>
